 <p>The year is 1991 and I am a typical 4 or 5 year old in kindergarten. Atypical to family my situation and unbeknownst to me at the time was the fact that I had a black dad and a white mom. To me they were just Mom and Dad, but to my mostly white elementary school peers there was something odd about the dichotomy of one being "white" and the other being "black". As such, they frequently asked me to explain myself and why I was a different color altogether from either of my parents. These were answers that I did not have, and as a typical mamas boy, I went to my mom for the answer.</p>
    
 
<p>After inquiring with her about my "color situation" she sat me down on the third step of our green carpeted stairwell to have me listen as she gave me information that would change everything in regards to how I saw myself and the world around me. My mother proceeded to tell me that she was my mother but there was another women who brought me into this world but had to give me up because she was two young to raise a child on her own. I would think about this mysterious women every single day for the next 25 years until we were reunited. <p>    

    
<p>I don't think words can accurately describe the significance of that moment for me, and I can't recall much else. I asked a lot of questions; I was told that she ran track and played basketball. This is where my love for the two comes from. I was told that even though she gave me up that she loved and I truly believed it.  I remember being too shocked to cry as my mother read the poem that hung on the wall in front of us as we talked. This was my first real memory and the moment when I truly began to love and appreciate life.<p>
 
    <p> Once there were two women who never knew each other.<br>                  
     One you do not remember, the other you call mother.<br> 
                    Two different lives, shaped to make your one<br> 
One became your guiding star, the other became your sun.<br> 
The first gave you life and the second taught you to live it.<br> 
The first gave you a need for love, and the second was there to give it.<br> 
One gave you a nationality, the other gave you a name.<br> 
One gave you a seed of talent, the other gave you an aim.<br> 
One gave you emotions, the other calmed your fears.<br> 
One saw your first sweet smile, the other dried your tears.<br> 
One gave you up ... that's all she could do.<br> 
The other prayed for a child and God led her straight to you.<br> 
And now you ask me, through your fears,<br>  
the age old question unanswered throughout the years...<br> 
Heredity or environment, which are you the product of?<br> 
Neither, my darling neither.<br> 
Just two different kinds of love.<br> 
                    <p>
   

                    


                       
 


<p>-Peace<p>
