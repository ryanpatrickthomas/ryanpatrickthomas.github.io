                    <p>Watching basketball with my brother and father was a favorite pastime of mine during my childhood.  As I began to watch an increasing number of games I became more aware of the “aesthetics of cool” that the NBA players presented.  Emulating their style on AND off the court became my mission.  Michael Jordan was undoubtedly the best player at the time but he was not my favorite player; I was drawn to likes of Isaiah Thomas, John Starks, and Kevin Johnson; short dudes who were quick.  As a third grader at the time, I was too short to mimic them on the court, but I was more than able and try and copy their fashion, particularly the hair styles.  All three of those players had a little bit of growth, usually faded, and often with some sort of line shaved to the side.  My parents were on board to help me obtain the look, pops as the resident barber, and they only had two requirements. The first was was simple enough, keep a comb and comb my hair before school; it was the second one that threw me for a loop.  My desire to grow my hair would introduce me to this stuff called “blue magic”,  an odd smelling, and odd looking blue hair dresser that black folk use...and it would change my life forever.</p>
                    <p>As the resident Token for most of my elementary school years I often found myself in interesting situations that were predicated on the perceived otherness of my DNA.  One of the most vivid in my consciousness is the remembrance that a lot of my peers seemed to have a weird obsession with touching and petting my hair.  When it was buzzed they would say said it tickled and felt like felt like sand paper, and when grown out it was soft was like wool.  These hair touching peers of mine came in all different shapes, sizes, and genders and In my head I divided the microregressors into a few separate groups.  <p>             
                    <p>The first group was of male schoolmates who were not my friends or acquaintances but felt privileged enough to touch or pet my hair without asking.  They mimicked their parents privilege well and annoyed the hell out of me.  If it wasn't for my insecurities about being different and not fitting I could have prevented their advances, but I wanted to be liked, and so I tolerated it.  Group number two included male peers  who were friends or team teammates and were at least kind enough to at least ask.
Lastly, the most important of these groups was of my female classmates, I like the motto “by any means necessary” and tried to apply that to my early love life.  The hair made for easy conversation, and the ladies were invited to touch my hair whenever they wanted, whether they asked or not. I was just a young player trying to play but I would soon realize the blue magic was not having it.  <p>                   
                    
                    <p>According to my parents, the blue grease was meant to help make my hair shine and easy to comb;  they were not sending a nappy headed Negro to school.  If I wanted to show up to class with hair like John Starks then it was combed and the blue grease was applied.  I looked good, but it was not all good.
When the Becky's in my elementary school touched my new good hair, combed and shiny with a fresh layer of that blue magic I was no longer met with kind looks and statements like “aww its so soft” but instead I got looks of disgust and proclamations that my shit was  “nasty”; they were in elementary school and probably didn't say “shit” but the point is that the outcome was not good .  Having to preemptively tell the girls that they probably shouldn't touch my hair was the exact opposite of what was supposed to happen and a major blow to my love life. At first I genuinely disliked the blue grease because of the figurative and literal layer it created against my love life, but I would eventually learn that there was a ying to that yang.</p>

                    <p>When I reflect back on this situation during my childhood, I am certain that sanitary concerns was the main reason that my parents instructed me to not allow others kids to touch my hair.  I'm sure their rational was that kids are dirty and boys don't wash their hands after touching their ding-a-lings while peeing.  The general rule of thumb was to “tell them to keep their hands to themselves”, but because of my insecurities I did not feel comfortable doing that.  Thankfully, on the very first day that I wore the stuff to school I would learn that the blue magic would do it for me, and add some humor at the same time.  
Watching Billy and Bob contemplate their life after touching my hair without asking, only to come up with an odd smelling, greasy hand was extremely satisfying to me and it became even more so when I thought about the fact that it would be on their hands for most of the school day; no amount of soap or water was going to do it quickly.    The blue magic affected my in-school relationships in two very different ways, it was also my first introduction to a “love and hate” relationship.  We grew apart, but sometimes that happens in life. </p>
                    <p>As with all relationships there are good moments and bad; my time with the blue magic was no different.  For all of its pros cons I eventually decided that growing my hair out and have to take care of it was more work than I felt like doing, and I kept it buzzed until college where I would eventually let it grow and leave it nappy without fear of objection from my parents.  The moral of the store is don't touch my hair.<p>
