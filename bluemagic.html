                    <p>Watching basketball with my brother and father was a favorite pastime of mine during my childhood.  As I began to watch an increasing number of games I became more aware of the “aesthetics of cool” that the NBA players presented.  Emulating their style on AND off the court became my mission.  Michael Jordan was undoubtedly the best player at the time but he was not my favorite; I was drawn to likes of Isaiah Thomas, John Starks, and Kevin Johnson; short dudes who were quick.  As a third grader at the time, I was too short to mimic them on the court, but I was more than able and try and copy their fashion, particularly the hair styles.  All three of those players had a little bit of growth, usually faded, and often with some sort of line shaved to the side.  My parents were on board to help me obtain the look; pops as the resident barber, and they only had two requirements. The first was was simple enough, keep a comb and comb my hair before school; it was the second one that threw me for a loop.  My desire to grow my hair would introduce me to this stuff called “blue magic”,  an odd smelling, and odd looking blue hair dresser that black folk use...and it would change my life forever.</p>
                    <p>As the resident Token for most of my elementary school years my I often found my self in unique situations that were predicated on the perceived uniqueness of my genetic otherness.  One of the most vivid in my consciousness is the remembrance that a lot of my peers seemed to have a weird obsession with touching and petting my hair.  When it was buzzed they would say said it tickled and felt like felt like sand paper, and when grown out it was soft was like wool.  These hair touching peers of mine came in all different shapes, sizes, and genders and In my head I divided the microregressors into a few separate groups.  <p>             
                    <p>The first group was of male schoolmates who weren't my friends acquaintances but felt privileged enough to touch or pet my hair without asking.  They mimicked their parents privilege well and annoyed the hell out of me.  If it wasn't for my insecurities about being different and not fitting I could have prevented their advances, but I wanted to be liked, and so I tolerated it.  Group number 2 included male peers friends, teammates and were kind enough to at least ask.
Lastly, the most important of these groups was of my female classmates, I like the motto “by any means necessary” and tried to apply that to my early love life.  The hair made for easy conversation and the ladies were invited to touch my hair whenever they wanted, whether they asked or not. I was just a young player trying to play but I would soon realize the blue magic was not having.  <p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
